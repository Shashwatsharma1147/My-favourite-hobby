            <h2>Playing guitar</h2>
            <p id="p1">The strings sounded like voices from a choir. Tone, the color of the sound, is a quality of the guitar that keeps me listening and practicing. The guitar is an instrument that fits me particularly well because it is a very individualistic instrument. I have to practice every day to hear what a great sound could feel like. I am currently learning guitar at Delhi school of music, there are many types of corses for guitar as there are may types generes of music. I learn Trinity rock and pop as I like to hear rock and pop music, thats all!!!</p><br>

            <p id="MSD">The Delhi School of Music, established by the Delhi Music Society, teaches Western classical music. It is the only institution of its kind in northern India. It has around 1300 students annually, and provides musical tuitions in instrumental (piano, guitar, violin, cello, clarinet, flute, recorder, saxophone, keyboard, drums) vocal and dance sections.

                The school is a center for the examinations of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, England, as well as the Trinity College of Music, London. There is growing emphasis not just on individual performance but on ensemble playing, aural development and musical appreciation. The staff and students of the School hone their skills through workshops conducted by both visiting artistes and other musicians, which also provide musical interaction. There are periodic pupils concerts and other events, which help to develop the performance skills of the students.</p>

            <img id="whatever" src="gettyimages-1185143893.webp">
            <p id="fac">The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that usually has six strings. It is typically played with both hands by strumming or plucking the strings with either a guitar pick or the fingers/fingernails of one hand, while simultaneously fretting (pressing the strings against the frets) with the fingers of the other hand. The sound of the vibrating strings is projected either acoustically, by means of the hollow chamber of the guitar (for an acoustic guitar), or through an electrical amplifier and a speaker.

                The guitar is a type of chordophone - wherein the sound is produced by way of a string, stretched between two fixed points, vibrating when plucked - traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.

                There are three main types of modern acoustic guitar: the classical guitar (Spanish guitar/nylon-string guitar), the steel-string acoustic guitar and the archtop guitar, which is sometimes called a "jazz guitar". The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' vibration, amplified by the hollow body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber. The classical guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive finger-picking technique where each string is plucked individually by the player's fingers, as opposed to being strummed. The term "finger-picking" can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and country guitar playing in the United States. The acoustic bass guitar is pitched one octave below a regular guitar.</p>
