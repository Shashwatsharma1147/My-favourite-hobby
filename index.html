        <h2>Playing guitar</h2>
        <p id="p1">The strings sounded like voices from a choir. Tone, the color of the sound, is a quality of the guitar that keeps me listening and practicing. The guitar is an instrument that fits me particularly well because it is a very individualistic instrument. I have to practice every day to hear what a great sound could feel like. I am currently learning guitar at Delhi school of music, there are many types of corses for guitar as there are may types generes of music. I learn Trinity rock and pop as I like to hear rock and pop music, thats all!!!</p><br>
